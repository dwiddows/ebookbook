\chapter{Using \latex for eBooks: Some Things to Avoid}

TODO: Complete and clean up at the end.

Not everything works. If you've used computers for a while, this is not a surprise. In particular in this case,
not everything that works in \latex for (say) PDF documents works for HTML and eBooks.

Things noticed in writing this book that should be avoided or figured out:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The traditional \latex command itself doesn't work.
    \item Footnotes are hard to get on the same page, even with -fn-in option.
    \item Getting a thumbnail image to compile automatically into the e-book format hasn't worked for me.
      TODO: See if this has to be done manually for each publisher.
    \item Boxes produced with the \texttt{wrapfig} package took up the whole width of the page, so marginal boxes didn't work properly this way. 
\end{itemize}
