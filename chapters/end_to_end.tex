%% The end to end process: second chapter.

\chapter{End to End: From Source to e-reader}

We'll start with the end-to-end process for making a book you can read
on your e-reader device. Seeing that you can do this, change the title,
add or remove chapters, and see the changes you've made reflected on your 
e-reader, will hopefully be the best encouragement to work through more
of the book focusing on the topics that are most useful for your own book.
