% The end to end process: second chapter.

\chapter{End to End: From Source to eReader}

We'll start with the end-to-end process for making a book you can read
on your eReader device. Once you can do this, change the title,
add or remove chapters, and see the changes you've made reflected on your 
eReader, that will hopefully be the best encouragement to take the
parts that are most useful and get started with your own book.
The basic outline of the process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pipeline}.
The rest of this chapter walks through the steps in more detail.

\section{Install Dependencies}

Typically when you want to use a new piece of software, it has
dependencies --- other libraries and packages it needs for some of its
functionality. For end-user applications, these are usually bundled
together so that everything works `out of the box'. For programming
tools, there's normally some system to check which dependencies you
already have, and to install only the new ones that you need. How this
works depends partly on what platform you're using. Here we'll just list
the dependencies you'll need to find and install.

These include:

\begin{itemize}
\item A \latex system, including a program called \smalltt{make4ht} or the older \smalltt{htlatex}.
  This is crucial for making HTML output, as described in Section
  \ref{sec:html2epub}.
\item Some eBook converter software. The one recommended below is
  \smalltt{ebook-convert}, from Calibre (see
  {\small \url{https://manual.calibre-eBook.com/ebook-convert.html}}, or just
  search the web).
\item Some eReader or previewer software, such as a Kindle device or
  app, or another eBook app such as Calibre (see above). You'll want
  this for seeing how your book looks `for real' (though of course,
  not all eBook apps look exactly alike, and users have different settings).
\item (Recommended) A shell program that runs bash scripts so that you
  can run the \smalltt{build.sh} command. If you don't already have a
  terminal where you can run bash or a close equivalent, it's probably
  worth installing and using, and if that instruction sounds
  difficult, the rest of the process may be hard.
\end{itemize}

Every modern operating system --- basically Windows, Linux, MacOS, and
similar variants --- has a variety of package installation tools.
Some of the dependencies above can be done at the command-line, sometimes it's
easier to download and install something directly from a provider's
website.

The best place to keep links to such dependencies and recommended options is the 
github project wiki at {\small \url{https://github.com/dwiddows/ebookbook/wiki}}.

\section{Access and Build the \latex Source}

Next, you'll want to get a copy of the source code for this
book. (\latex sources count as
`code' for these purposes. It gives instructions to machines, it's easy to make mistakes
that show up as error messages, and it's reviewed and stored in source
control --- so it's like code in these practical senses.)

If you already have \smalltt{git} installed, this will be something
like running \smalltt{git clone
  https://github.com/dwiddows/ebookbook.git} at a command prompt, or
downloading the code using some visual client software. 

List the contents of this directory and check that you can see the
files \smalltt{ebookbook.tex} and \smalltt{build.sh}. The first of these
is the main \tex document that lays out how to combine the other files
into an eBook.  The second is a build script --- on platforms with
bash or a compatible shell installed, you should be able to run just
\smalltt{./build.sh} and get most of the book built using one
command. Or at least, to begin with, you should get error messages
telling you if anything is missing and needs to be installed. If you're not
running a compatible shell, the \smalltt{build.sh} file at least lists
the commands you'll need to run some other way.

So the next step is to run \smalltt{./build.sh} and ideally it should
typeset a copy of this book. If the \smalltt{ebook-convert} command is
available it should even make the eBook files described in the next
section.

If this doesn't work, you may need to find and install some
\smalltt{pdflatex} and most importantly \smalltt{make4ht} or
\smalltt{htlatex} programs that work on your machine. (See the
Dependencies section above.)

So long as you can run ``\sverb|make4ht ebookbook|'' and create a file \sverb|ebookbook.html|,
you can go on to the next step.

\section{From HTML to ePub ... or Mobi}
\label{sec:html2epub}

The most important output from the previous step is a file called
\smalltt{ebookbook.html}.  This is formatted for display as a webpage
in a browser. This is different from the more common use of \tex to
make documents such as academic papers, which are nowadays normally
created as PDF files. An HTML file is a collection of content (for
example, words and images to display), and typesetting suggestions
(for example, make this text a heading, and make this image 40\% of
the screen width). By contrast, a PDF file has
precise instructions about how big to make each character and which
page to put it on. So it makes sense that HTML is more like an eBook:
instead of saying what text will appear on which page, it gives
directives about what text should be bigger and smaller, and this
combines with the user's device settings to decide which page it
should appear on.

So the \smalltt{ebookbook.html} file (rather than the corresponding
PDF file or any other page-layout format) will be used to
create your eBook format. 

You can turn your HTML file from a webpage into an eBook by installing
and using a converter such as Calibre \smalltt{ebook-convert} or
Amazon's {\em Kindle Previewer} tool.
Like saving an image as a
\smalltt{.jpg}, \smalltt{.gif} or \smalltt{.png}, you'll need to select a
format to convert to. Options include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \smalltt{.epub} is a cross-platform format that it supposed to
    be used for any electronic book.
  \item \smalltt{.mobi} is an old Amazon Kindle format --- and it
    happens to be the one you can use for e-mailing files to your Kindle.
\end{itemize}

The \smalltt{build.sh} script that comes with this book uses
\smalltt{ebook-convert} and creates both \smalltt{.epub} and
\smalltt{.mobi} files as output. This also takes command-line
arguments so that you can specify metadata like the author name
and cover image:

{\flushleft \quad \smalltt{ebook-convert ebookbook.html ebookbook.epub --cover images/cover.jpg --authors "YOUR NAME" --language English}}

\section{Previewing Your Book on an eReader}

Hopefully by now you have an eBook. Or at least, a file called something like
\smalltt{ebookbook.epub}. So how do you {\em read} your book?

For this you'll need an eReader --- perhaps an app on your computer or phone,
or an eReader device such as a Kindle.

Assuming that most of your writing will be on a computer, that's
probably the first place you'll want to see your work. For example, I
usually open the Calibre app and load the \sverb|.epub| file, or do both at
once with the command \smalltt{calibre ebookbook.epub}. Once the book is imported and loaded, this gives 
the result shown in Figure \ref{fig:calibre_screenshot}.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/calibre_screenshot.png}
    \htbr
    \caption{Thumbnail image and cover page in Calibre}
\label{fig:calibre_screenshot}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To view on an eReader device or phone, you often have to send it to
the device or load it on in some way --- again, there are a range of
methods. For Amazon Kindles, you need to find / set up an email address for the
device itself, and send the book to that email address. As an extra
complexity, this method only works using the older \smalltt{.mobi}
files.  Also Kindle preloads like this do not (at the moment)
display the cover page of the book in your library or menu page,
because Amazon retrieves this information for {\em published} books
from elsewhere. So the preview in the library view is somewhat
disappointing, but it works (Figure \ref{fig:kindle_screenshot}).

Another way is to sign up for a publishing account and start to submit your book for
publication. On the Kindle publishing site, for example, this process includes opportunities
to preview your book as it would appear on a phone and a Kindle device, before you set up
pricing options and get closer to hitting `publish'. For this book at least, these online previewers
gave a more accurate rendering of how the book will look to readers than emailing a \smalltt{.mobi} file to my
Kindle device.

One way or another, try to make sure you can make an eBook file and view it somewhere.

\section{Make it Your Own!}

Hopefully by now you're at the point where there is an eBook file that you can easily read on some eReader device or app. 

The next thing you should do is change something. Change the title in the \smalltt{cover\_page.tex} file from `\latex to eBook 2021'
to whatever title you want. Rerun the steps above and hopefully you'll see exactly what you intended: a copy of the eBook, but with
your title instead.

At this point you're off to the races. That doesn't mean that it's all plain sailing from here: there will likely be glitches and hurdles along the way.
But the main thing is that you have a template, examples of several \latex constructs that work with eBooks, and you're able to start turning this
into your own book. You may want to save your work separately at this point, call the project something else, and if you use source control,
start checking in your work in some way that makes it clear that it's a new project, rather than a work-in-progress on the old project that's intended to be
merged back in at some point.

Experiment with removing directives to \sverb|\input| different chapters, and watch the book get shorter. Try changing image files to some other graphic
and make sure they change appropriately. And try editing the AUTHOR in the \smalltt{build.sh} file and make sure the right name shows up when the book is viewed in an eReader.

If this works, you can be pretty confident that your book is on the right track. You'll be able to organize the content into \tex files, image files, etc., and create an eBook!

\section{Publication}

Nearly all of this book is about how to create and preview eBook files, and this is like a software development process
--- you should be able to run the pipeline over and over again and keep testing that the change you made had the desired effect.

Publishing and marketing your book is a different process: you'll be using an online browser app, signing up for accounts, uploading files, filling in forms,
you'll eventually click "submit", and hopefully see your book available for download / purchase after a short while (in the case of this book, a few hours).
Look for opportunities to preview your book as part of the submission process.

This process with Amazon Kindle has was straightforward enough form-filling. You can upload your own cover image, or use the online tools
to create one. Submission for publication brings up questions like pricing and (related) copyright agreements. To claim a 70\% royalty for original work,
rather than a 35\% royalty, Amazon says you have to price your book between \$2.99 and \$9.99. Hence the \$2.99 price tag for this book.

It takes at least a few hours before your book is live and available --- and it may take longer to start appearing in search results.

Note that you can upload new versions of your book any time. Updates (at least minor ones) get automatically processed and released
in just the same way as the initial submission. With this book, for example, I submitted two revisions within a few hours, because of
course once I was viewing the book `for real' on my phone, there were a couple of typos and small mistakes I wanted to fix.
So in the case of this book, I published it and updated the live version a few times before even telling people it was available.

If you found this book in the Kindle store and can read this as a result, it worked. And if I could do this, you can too!
