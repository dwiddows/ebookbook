\chapter{Introduction to \latex and eBooks}

Considering writing a book? Good for you! Publishing a book is easier and cheaper today 
that it ever has been. 

If you know what you want to write about, the next step (and sometimes the 
hardest step) is getting started. The most important part is the material itself: 
you can write pragraphs in any number of text and document editors, 
and figure out how to format the material as a book later. But sooner or later, 
the question arises of how to turn the material into a book format. That could mean a paper book, 
which requires physical resources for printing and distributing. Or it could mean
an eBook, to be read on an eReader such as an Amazon Kindle or Kobo Clara.

So how do you turn your document into an eBook? This is a very short book demonstrating one 
way to do this, and if you're reading this on an eReader, that shows
that it already worked at least once --- for this book!

To start with, I chose to use the \latex typesetting system. 
The original \tex was created by the famous computer scientist Donald Knuth \citep{knuth1984texbook},
and added to by Leslie Lamport to make \latex \citep{lamport1985latex}.
\latex is used throughout scientific fields to write papers and books. There are many
reasons for preferring \latex to one of the more `point, click, and type' text editors:
it handles figures, tables, chapters, sections, headings, cross-references, 
bibliographic references, mathematical equations, and many more things that can be 
notoriously irritating and time consuming to get right. And it's easy to use different typesetting
programs and commands to create all sorts of output from \latex input, including eBooks.

If \tex and \latex are entirely unfamiliar to you, even this automation and flexibility 
may not make it the best choice for you, because there is quite a technical 
learning-curve for \latex. It's not just writing text, it's writing commands telling the
typesetting program how to `compile' the output document --- in many ways, \latex
feels much more like programming than writing a Google or Microsoft Word document. But if
\latex is something you've already used to write a dissertation or paper, you're 
probably well aware of its benefits (and its hassles). 

In summary, if you've used \latex to write papers, now you want to write an eBook,
and you need to figure out how to do this, then this little book and
the open source template that it comes from might be ideal.
There are alternatives --- alternative ways to make eBooks, and about
using \latex to make eBooks. This book is not intended to be comprehensive. It's
intended to enable you to make an eBook end-to-end quickly, cheaply, and easily.

\section{How to Use this Book}

This is a book about itself --- it's written using the templates and tools described in 
the next few chapters. These are the main ways you can use this material:

\begin{itemize}
    \item You can read it. It shouldn't take long, it outlines the process
    used to make this eBook end to end, and then you can decide if this is something you want to try.
    \item You can use it as an instruction manual, learning and following some of the procedures step-by-step to make your own book.
    \item You can use it as a template. All of the source files used to make this book
    are freely available in GitHub at {\small \url{https://github.com/dwiddows/ebookbook}} and Overleaf.
    The source files are laid out in a way that should make it easy to clone the project and adapt it for your own book.
\end{itemize}

It follows that you could recreate this eBook for yourself, following just the process
described in the book: which is basically to clone the GitHub or Overleaf 
project as a template, build
the project, send the output HTML document through an ePub converter, and send this to
your eReader device. So why would anyone buy this book if it's free? Because
anyone who reads the steps above and immediately thinks ``hmmm \ldots git clone \ldots build.sh \ldots 
pipe \ldots ship \ldots yeah, alright'' will expect that it will take a little while to get working 
end to end, that their time is valuable, and that the price tag of this book is small
compared. So if you want to read this book for free on your eReader,
compiling from source is the way to go about it. Or if you want to just click `buy' now and send the author most of the
\$2.99 price tag, please go ahead, and thank you!

Either way, if you're not put off by \latex and \smalltt{git}
commands, keep reading. I hope the book is useful to you, and wish you 
all the best of luck and perseverance writing your book!
