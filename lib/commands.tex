% This file is for commands / macros / functions.

% That at least was the original intention. As you can see from the comments, some of the commands
% that work for TeX and pdf output are innefective when applied to HTML and eBooks!

% These are useful because HTML output corrupts the result of the \latex command.
\newcommand{\latex}{LaTeX\xspace}
